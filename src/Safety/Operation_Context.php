/**
 * Per-request note of the snapshot operation ids Safe_Mutation created, so an
 * observer wrapped around a tool call (MCP\Registrar's execute wrapper, issue
 * #134) can link that call's outcome row to the undo point it produced without
 * every tool having to report it.
 *
 * Safe_Mutation::run() appends an id here the moment the snapshot is safely
 * persisted, never before: a row may only advertise an undo point that really
 * exists.
 *
 * Observers bracket a call with mark() ... since($mark) rather than resetting
 * the list, so a tool that dispatches another tool (Tools\Dispatch\Call_Tool)
 * cannot clear the outer observer's view. since() returns the FIRST id noted
 * after the mark, which is the earliest undo point for that call: restoring it
 * rewinds the furthest back, which is what an admin chasing a suspect write
 * wants.
