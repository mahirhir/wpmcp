/**
 * The two switches of the agent project-memory feature (issue #131), kept
 * deliberately separate because they protect opposite things:
 *
 *  - wpmcp_enable_memory (DEFAULT FALSE) gates the three memory TOOLS
 *    (memory-recall, memory-propose, memory-save-summary), i.e. the paths
 *    an agent can use to read or write the store. Opt-in like every other
 *    non-core capability wpmcp ships.
 *
 *  - wpmcp_memory_enforce (DEFAULT TRUE) gates ENFORCEMENT of the
 *    admin-published block rules inside Registrar::is_permitted(). It is on
 *    by default and is intentionally NOT tied to the tools switch, the pro
 *    license, or the connecting identity: a guardrail an administrator
 *    published must keep denying writes even after the memory tools are
 *    switched back off or a license lapses. A guardrail that quietly stops
 *    guarding is worse than no guardrail at all, so the only way to stop
 *    enforcement is an explicit filter or unpublishing the entry.
