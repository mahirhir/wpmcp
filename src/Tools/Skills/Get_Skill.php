/**
 * Read-only: load one skill's full instructions by slug (issue #74).
 *
 * Returns the SKILL.md body exactly as it is on disk, byte for byte below the
 * frontmatter block (only the blank lines surrounding it are trimmed).
 * Nothing is truncated, reflowed, or summarized: oversized documents are
 * refused at discovery time
 * (Skill_Library::MAX_FILE_BYTES) precisely so that everything the catalog
 * lists can be served verbatim, and an agent that caches a body keyed by
 * `version` knows it holds the real thing.
 *
 * Every failure is a structured WP_Error carrying the data an agent needs to
 * recover on its own:
 *  - wpmcp_skill_slug_required: no slug given.
 *  - wpmcp_skill_not_found: unknown slug, with the known slugs attached so
 *    the agent can retry without a second list-skills round trip.
 *  - wpmcp_skill_locked: the skill declares `tier: pro` and this site is not
 *    licensed. The catalog entry stays visible, only the body is withheld.
 *
 * The slug is a lookup key into the scanned catalog, never a path fragment:
 * see Skill_Library::get().
