/**
 * Read-only listing of the managed redirects (issue #128), newest first,
 * with optional enabled/search filters and paging.
 *
 * Each row is returned with its effective_target resolved the same way the
 * front-end handler resolves it, so an agent sees the URL visitors would
 * actually be sent to (a post-id-backed row shows the post's current
 * permalink) rather than having to re-derive it. An empty effective_target
 * means the row's target post is gone and the redirect is inert, which is
 * surfaced as `active` so it does not have to be inferred.
 *
 * The pending suggestion queue is included too, so the same call that shows
 * what IS redirected also shows what the plugin thinks SHOULD be, without a
 * second tool on the tools/list surface.
