/**
 * The run-wp-cli tool handler (issue #44): runs a guarded, allowlisted wp-cli
 * subcommand and returns its stdout/stderr/exit code.
 *
 * The guard chain itself lives in Wp_Cli_Guard_Chain::assert_allowed(), which
 * composes every Wp_Cli_Guard check in order. It was extracted there when the
 * background job dispatcher (issue #84) needed the identical chain: the two
 * entry points share one implementation rather than two copies that could
 * drift, and the shared-guard tests in
 * tests/free/Cli/WpCliGuardChainSharedTest.php drive the same refusal matrix
 * through both to prove it.
 *
 * Every attempt, allowed or denied, is recorded via Governance_Audit_Log,
 * same as the ordinary permission-check audit trail (Registrar::record_audit):
 * only the ability name, active identity, and allow/deny outcome are logged,
 * never the command/argv itself, so a wp-cli invocation touching a secret
 * (e.g. `option get some_api_key`) never leaks that secret into the log.
 *
 * The actual subprocess run is injected as a callable (default: the real
 * Wp_Cli_Executor::run), so tests can supply a fake that records the argv it
 * was called with and returns a canned result, without ever spawning a
 * process. This is the seam the guard-behavior tests in
 * tests/free/Cli/RunWpCliTest.php exercise.
 *
 * Full architecture writeup, including exactly what is CI-tested versus
 * production-only (the real proc_open round-trip) and flags left for the
 * adversarial security review: .superpowers/sdd/issue-44-report.md.
