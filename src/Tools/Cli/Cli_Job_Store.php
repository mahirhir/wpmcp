/**
 * CRUD plus stale-record cleanup over a single wpmcp_cli_jobs option (issue
 * #84), deliberately shaped like Backup_Job_Store so the two async job
 * surfaces read the same way: an array with a 'next_id' sequence counter and
 * a 'jobs' map of job id => job record.
 *
 * A job record is { id, command, argv, timeout, status, created_at,
 * updated_at, result, error } where status is one of
 * queued|running|completed|failed|canceled and result (once the job has run)
 * is { stdout, stderr, exit_code, timed_out, truncated, output_bytes }.
 *
 * Job ids are a deterministic incrementing integer sequence, and timestamps
 * come from an injectable clock (set_clock_for_tests), for the same
 * repeatability reason as Backup_Job_Store: the store and its WP-Cron
 * executor are exercised together, and a random or wall-clock-derived value
 * would make those tests non-deterministic.
 *
 * UNLIKE the governance audit log, a job record DOES retain the command and
 * its captured output: an agent that dispatched a job has to be able to read
 * back what it dispatched and what came out, which is the entire point of
 * the poll tool. That is a deliberate, bounded trade-off rather than an
 * oversight, and it is why purge_stale() exists: records are dropped on a
 * retention TTL and a hard record cap, so captured output (which may include
 * whatever the command printed) does not accumulate in wp_options forever.
