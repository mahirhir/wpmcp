/**
 * The WP-Cron executor for a queued CLI job (issue #84), mirroring
 * Run_Backup_Job's shape: Dispatch_Cli_Job schedules a single event on
 * self::HOOK with the job id as its only argument, and Plugin::boot() hooks
 * self::HOOK to [new Run_Cli_Job(), 'handle'] so WordPress invokes it on the
 * next cron run.
 *
 * Three things this does that a fire-and-forget detached spawn cannot:
 *
 *  1. RE-GUARDS before executing. The stored argv is re-run through the full
 *     Wp_Cli_Guard_Chain here, not trusted because it passed at dispatch
 *     time. Between queueing and this run the operator may have closed the
 *     wpmcp_allow_wp_cli gate, the environment may now report production, or
 *     the allowlist may have been narrowed. Revoking permission has to stop
 *     already-queued work, otherwise the queue is a way to outlive the gate.
 *     A now-refused job is recorded as failed with the guard's own message.
 *  2. Captures output under a hard size cap, so a chatty command cannot
 *     inflate an option row (and the poll response) without bound.
 *  3. Records a denied/allowed audit entry for the actual execution, not
 *     just for the dispatch, following the run-wp-cli convention: ability
 *     name, identity, and outcome only, never the command.
 *
 * A job that is not in 'queued' status when this fires is left alone: it was
 * canceled, already ran, or is a duplicate cron delivery, and re-running a
 * command because WP-Cron fired twice would be worse than skipping. An
 * unknown job id is a silent no-op for the same reason as Run_Backup_Job:
 * there is no record to flip and cron has no caller to report to.
 *
 * The subprocess run is a constructor-injected callable defaulting to the
 * real Wp_Cli_Executor::run, exactly as in Run_Wp_Cli, so tests exercise the
 * status transitions and output handling without spawning a process.
